# Power

Explaining what a PSU does and the measurement units

**Voltage (V)**: The electrical potential difference. It’s the force that pushes electric charges through a circuit.

Example: A standard wall outlet in many countries provides about 120V or 230V AC.

**Current (I)**: The flow of electric charge, measured in Amperes (A or Amps).

Example: A device might draw 2A of current from the power source.

**Power (P)**: The rate at which electrical energy is consumed or generated, measured in Watts (W). It is calculated as:

> P = V x I

> (P=120V×2A=240W)

## AC vs DC

| Feature   | AC                      | DC                          |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Direction | Alternates periodically | Flows in one direction only |
| Waveform  | Sine wave (usually)     | Constant (flat line)        |
| Frequency | Measured in Hertz (Hz)  | No frequency; steady flow   |

## PSU steps

- Input: The PSU draws 120V AC and 1.5A, consuming 180W of power.
- Rectification: AC is converted to pulsating DC.
- Filtering/Regulation: The output voltage is regulated to a stable 12V DC.
- Output: The PSU provides up to 10A at 12V, resulting in a maximum power output of 120W.
