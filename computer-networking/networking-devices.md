# Modem

- Physical Layer
- Serves as the bridge between digital devices (like computers) and the transmission medium (like phone lines, fiber, or cable) that may require analog signals.
- Short for modulator-demodulator. It performs modulation (Digital → Analog) and demodulation (Analog → Digital) to convert signals for transmission.

# Hub

- Physical Layer
- Connects multiple computers or devices in a local area network (LAN). Hubs receive incoming data signals from one port and broadcast them to all other ports.
- Inefficient use of bandwidth, less commonly used today, as switches are more efficient.

# Repeater

- Physical Layer
- Extends the range of a network by amplifying or regenerating signals over long distances.
- Often used in large networks or to extend signal coverage in areas with poor connectivity.

# Switch

- Data Link Layer
- Connects multiple devices (like computers, printers, or servers) in a local area network (LAN) using wired connections (Ethernet cables) and forwards data only to the device that needs it.
- Stores and uses MAC addresses in a CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table to forward data more efficiently.

# WAP (Wireless Access Point)

- Data Link Layer
- Provides wireless connectivity to devices in a local area network (LAN).
- Allows devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets to connect to the network wirelessly by transmitting and receiving data using radio waves.

# Bridge

- Data Link Layer
- Connects separate network segments together.
- More efficient than hubs, as it filters traffic and reduces collisions between network segments.

# Router

- Network Layer
- Responsible for directing data packets between different networks, typically between a local network (like your home network) and the internet

# Firewall

- Network Layer / Transport Layer
- Protects a network from unauthorized access, typically by filtering traffic based on rules.
- Can be hardware (A physical device connected to the router) or software-based (modern routers have built-in firewall software) and helps secure network boundaries.
- A firewall can be either stateless or stateful

# IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

- Security system that monitors network or system activities for signs of malicious activity.
- Detects attacks but doesn’t block them.

# IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

- Security system that monitors network or system activities and actively blocks malicious activities.
- Detects and actively blocks attacks.

# VPN concentrator

- A device that manages and secures multiple VPN connections, allowing remote users or sites to securely access a private network.
- Less used nowadays

# Load Balancer

- Transport Layer / Application Layer
- Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
- Helps prevent overloading a single server and ensures high availability of services.

# Proxy Server

- Application Layer
- Sits between users and the internet to control access and improve privacy (hides and protects the requesting client)
- Can save (cache) web data to load pages faster and reduce internet use.

# Gateway

- Various Layers, depending on function and placement in network
- Connects separate networks with different protocols or technologies.
- Often acts as a translator between different network architectures or protocols.
