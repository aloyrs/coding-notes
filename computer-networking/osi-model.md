**Introduction:**

- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different networking protocols and technologies communicate in a network.
- It consists of seven distinct layers, each with its own unique function and purpose.
- The OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to facilitate interoperability and communication between different network devices and systems.

**Seven Layers of the OSI Model:**

1. **Physical Layer:**

   - This layer deals with the physical medium and transmission of raw bits over a physical link.
   - It specifies the hardware characteristics, such as cables, connectors, and network interface cards.
   - Key components: voltage levels, cable types, and bit rate.

2. **Data Link Layer:**

   - Responsible for framing, addressing, and error detection on the physical layer.
   - It organizes data into frames and ensures reliable data transfer between adjacent nodes.
   - Key components: MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, Ethernet, and framing.

3. **Network Layer:**

   - Focuses on routing and forwarding data between different networks and subnets.
   - It uses logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses) to determine the best path for data packets.
   - Key components: IP addresses, routers, and routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP).

4. **Transport Layer:**

   - Manages end-to-end communication and data segmentation.
   - It provides error detection, flow control, and data reassembly.
   - Key components: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5. **Session Layer:**

   - Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between devices.
   - It controls the dialogue and ensures data synchronization between applications.
   - Key components: Session initiation, termination, and management.

6. **Presentation Layer:**

   - Responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression.
   - It ensures that data is presented in a readable format for the application layer.
   - Key components: Data encryption, character encoding, and data compression.

7. **Application Layer:**
   - This is the topmost layer that interacts directly with end-user applications.
   - It provides services and protocols that allow applications to communicate over the network.
   - Key components: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and application-specific protocols.
