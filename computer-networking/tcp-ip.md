**TCP/IP Model**

1. **Application Layer**

   - Manages user applications and interactions.
   - Protocols: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS.
   - Defines data presentation and offers encryption and authentication services.

2. **Transport Layer**

   - Handles end-to-end communication and data segmentation.
   - Includes TCP (reliable) and UDP (fast, not reliable).
   - TCP: Connection-oriented, data integrity, flow control, error correction.
   - UDP: Connectionless, used for real-time applications.
   - Three-Way Handshake: Used in TCP to establish connections.

3. **Internet Layer**

   - Focuses on addressing and routing data across networks.
   - Uses Internet Protocol (IP), including IPv4 and IPv6.
   - Routers operate at this layer to forward data.

4. **Link Layer**
   - Deals with physical data transmission over network media (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
   - Manages data frames, MAC addressing, error detection, and medium access control.
   - Network interface cards (NICs) and switches are part of this layer.

**Key Points**

- TCP/IP model consists of four layers.
- Application Layer handles user applications and services.
- Transport Layer manages end-to-end communication with TCP and UDP.
- Internet Layer is responsible for addressing and routing using IP.
- Link Layer handles physical data transmission and network media access.
- Three-Way Handshake is used in the Transport Layer to establish reliable connections with TCP.

These notes provide a concise overview of the TCP/IP model, its key layers, and their roles in computer networking.
