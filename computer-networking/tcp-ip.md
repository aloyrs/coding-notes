# TCP/IP Model

> TCP/IP model consists of 4 Layers

![Untitled](Untitled%203.png)

- Application layer
- Transport layer
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical layer

# Encapsulation & Decapsulation process

> Adding and removing headers and trailers to data as it is transmitted through the layers of the model

# Application Layer

Where users interact , on devices

- Web browser: Chrome
- Email clients: Microsoft Outlook
- HTTP , FTP , SMTP
- Whats app

## Status codes

## Cookies

HTTP is stateless, so cookies is used to by browser to remember user data.

> Cookie: A small text file stored on a user's device by a website, used to remember user preferences and activity.

### Third party cookies

> Third-party cookie: A cookie set by a domain other than the one that the user is currently visiting, used for tracking user behavior across different websites.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

> System that translates domain names (e.g. [**www.google.com**](http://www.example.com/)) into IP addresses

eg:

[blog.example.com](http://blog.example.com/)

blog = sub domain

example = second-level domain (SLD)

.com = top-level domain(TLD)

## DHCP (**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**)

- _DHCP is a network protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses_

# Transport Layer

> Guarantee the end to end delivery of data between application and server

**_Data in form of segments_**

>

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

- Segment Numbering System
- Connection oriented
- Error control
- Flow Control
- Congestion control
- Full Duplex : data can be sent in both directions at the same time.

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

> _UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless, unreliable transport protocol that allows for fast and efficient transmission of data packets over a network._

**UDP is often used in scenarios where immediate delivery of data is more important than reliability**

- Unreliable : does not guarantee the delivery of data, and packets may be lost or delivered out of order
- Connectionless : does not establish a connection before transmitting data.
- No congestion control

Example :

- Voice over IP (VoIP) like Skype or Zoom
- Online Gaming
- Streaming Media

## Features

- Features meaning
  ## Multiplexing
  ![Untitled](Untitled%2011.png)
  ## **TCP Congestion Control**
  > Manage the rate at which data is transmitted over a network
  > Ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver with data, causing packets to be dropped or delayed
  ## Checksum
  > Extra data calculated from data using a math formula
  > If check sum at receiving end does not match the checksum sent with the data, data is corrupted and data should be retransmitted
  ## TCP Timers
  1. Retransmission timer: This timer is used by the sender to retransmit packets if they are not acknowledged within a specified time period.
  2. Keep-alive timer: This timer is used by the receiver to ensure that the sender is still active and able to receive data.

## 3 Way Handshake

> This could also be seen as a way of how TCP connection is established.

1. SYN (Synchronize) - Sender (client) sending a SYN message to the receiver (server) to initiate a connection request. This message contains a random sequence number that is generated by the sender
2. SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) - After receiving the SYN message, the receiver (server) responds with a SYN-ACK message. This message contains an acknowledgment of the sequence number sent by the sender and also a randomly generated sequence number
3. ACK (Acknowledgment) - The final step of the 3-way handshake involves the sender (client) sending an ACK message to the receiver (server). This message contains an acknowledgment of the sequence number sent by the receiver

# Network Layer

> To find the optimal path for data packets to travel through the network

**_Data in form of packets_**

Routers use IP addresses to route the packets

>

## IP (Internet Protocol)

## IPv4

Might not be enough for world population

## IPv6

# Data Link Layer

- Ethernet , switches

## MAC (Media access control) address
