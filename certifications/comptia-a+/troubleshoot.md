# Troubleshooting

- Blue Screen of Death
- can access S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) for storage drives using third party utilities
- Input/output operations per second (IOPS): Hard drive: 200 IOPS , SSD: 1,000,000 IOPS

## Network

- Signal to noise ratio (SNR)

When a device connects to a router without a DHCP server, it assigns itself an IP address in the APIPA range (169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254). Enables local communication with other devices in local network only

- Packet Capture for network trouble shooting
- Latency : A delay between the request and the response
- Port flapping : Refers to the repeated cycling of a network port between an up (active) and down (inactive) state
