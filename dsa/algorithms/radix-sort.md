    Radix Sort: This algorithm sorts elements by digit, from the least significant digit to the most significant digit. It sorts the elements based on each digit, then combines the sorted digits to get the final sorted array. It has a linear time complexity of O(d * (n+k)), where d is the number of digits in the largest number.
