# Time Complexity

 

**HOW DOES ALGORITHM SPEED SCALE AS INPUT SCALES?**

To get time complexity :

- Drop lower order terms
- Drop all constant multipliers

> $T(n)=2n^2+3n+1=O(n)$

# Time to Space trade-off / relationship

Time ↑ Space ↓

**OR**

Time ↑ Space ↓

Which ? Choose time or space ? 

Answer : Usually “ Time ↑ Space ↓ “ 

Because we can buy memory for space but not time
