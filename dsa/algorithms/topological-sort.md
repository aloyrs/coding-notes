# Topological Sort

> Takes a **Directed Acyclic Graph*** and returns an array of the nodes where each node appears before all the nodes it points to.
> 

- **Directed Acyclic Graph* →** *directed graph with no cycles*

Have all nodes in straight line pointing right

- Topological sort is not unique ( can have more one topological ordering )

# Indegree vs Outdegree

![Untitled](Untitled%2052.png)

- vertex 4 has 3 incoming edges and 3 outgoing edges , so indegree is 3 and outdegree is 3.
- vertex 7 has 2 indegree and 1 outdegree :)
