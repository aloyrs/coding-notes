# Data Structures I actually need

# Abstract Data Type (ADT)

![Untitled](Untitled.png)

## Priority Queue

- Similar to a queue but each element has a priority
- An element with high priority is dequeued (lowest number = highest priority)

eg . Implement priority queue using a binary heap 
( because heaps have best possible time complexity)

# Arrays

*In Python, list is implemented as dynamic array, in other languages like Java, C++ there are both dynamic and static arrays

![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)

## Static Array

> Fixed length container which indexable n elements from [0,n-1]
> 

## Dynamic Array

> An array with automatic resizing
> 

|  | Static Array | Dynamic Array |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access | O(1) | O(1) | Access by index |
| Search | O(n) | O(n) | Traverse through array |
| Insertion | NA | O(n) | Have to shift all elements to right after insertion |
| Appending | NA | O(1) | Add to end  |
| Deletion | NA | O(n) | Have to shift elements after deletion  |

# Linked lists

Sequential list of vertices that hold data and point to other vertices that also hold data

## Terminology

| Head  | First node  |
| --- | --- |
| Tail | Last node |
| Pointer | reference to another node |
| Node | Object containing data and pointer |

![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)

## Singly Linked List

Only hold a reference to the next node

### Inserting into Singly

- Example

## Doubly Linked List

Hold a reference to the next and previous

### Inserting into Doubly

- Example
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%2010.png)
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%2011.png)
    

### Removing from Doubly

- Example
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%2012.png)
    
    ![4‚Äôs pointer to 15](Untitled%2013.png)
    
    4‚Äôs pointer to 15
    
    ![15‚Äôs previous pointer to 4](Untitled%2014.png)
    
    15‚Äôs previous pointer to 4
    
    ![Untitled](Untitled%2015.png)
    

|  | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Singly | Use less memory (pointers use memory)

Simpler Implementation | Cannot easily access previous elements
(Traverse from head to previous node)
 |
| Doubly | Can be traversed backwards | Takes 2x memory |

- comparator > 0 , is in right subtree

Replace node with successor to maintain BST invariant 

Case 1 : Leaf node

- Remove without any side effect

OR

Tree based data structure that satisfies the heap invariant (aka. heap property)

Value of parent vertex is always ‚â• value of all child vertex (max heap)
Value of parent vertex is always ‚â§ value of all child vertex (min heap)

# Hash Table/Hash map

![Untitled](Untitled%2044.png)

A data structure provide mapping from key to value using hashing

## Hash function

**H(x)** is a function that maps key ‚Äòx‚Äô to whole number in a range 

![Untitled](Untitled%2045.png)

key ‚Üí hash function converts key to an index ‚Üí index to value

$H(x) = (x^2 + 3) mod10$

if key x = 3 , 

$H(3) = (3^2 + 3) mod10 = 2$

![Key 3 is at index 2](Untitled%2046.png)

Key 3 is at index 2

## Time complexity

![Untitled](Untitled%2047.png)

## Collision Handling in Hash Table

Happens when different keys are hashed to the same value 

### Seperate Chaining

Create a linked list at the index , append to the link list when collision occurs

![Untitled](Untitled%2048.png)

### Open Addressing

1. Linear Probing
2. Quadratic Probing 
3. Double hashing

Load Factor ( $Œ±$ ) = items in table / size of table

![Chaining vs Linear Probing . Linear Probing exponentially bad as approaching 0.8 and above](Untitled%2049.png)

Chaining vs Linear Probing . Linear Probing exponentially bad as approaching 0.8 and above

![N is size of hashtable, P(k,x) is the probing function](Untitled%2050.png)

N is size of hashtable, P(k,x) is the probing function

### Linear Probing

![**a** and **N** should be relatively prime , have their Greatest Common Denominator (GCD) as 1 to avoid infinite loop](Untitled%2051.png)

**a** and **N** should be relatively prime , have their Greatest Common Denominator (GCD) as 1 to avoid infinite loop

To avoid infinite loop in Linear Probing , usually P(x) = x , where a =1

so while loop will increase the index by one every loop , 

find next available slot for the key

Linearly searching for the next empty slot to prevent collision

![Untitled](Untitled%2052.png)

### Quadratic Probing

 

![Untitled](Untitled%2053.png)

If index is taken , probe with P(0) then P(1) so on until an empty slot is found

![empty slot at 0 was found after probing with P(2)](Untitled%2054.png)

empty slot at 0 was found after probing with P(2)

### Double Hashing

Probes by using a second hash function with a constant multiplier 

index = hash1(k) + x*hash2(k)

![Untitled](Untitled%2055.png)

*constant multiplier(x)  : 0 ‚Üí until empty index

P(0) ‚Üí index = hash1(k) + 1*hash2(k)

P(1) ‚Üí index = hash1(k) + 1*hash2(k)

...

### Removing in Open Addressing

Remove and replace with ‚Äúü™¶‚Äù( tombstone )

When searching with probing, skip over ‚Äúü™¶‚Äù and keep probing

# Graph

Non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges

Used to represent networks

Undirected Graph - no direction between vertices 

Directed Graph - one direction between vertices

Weighted Graph - Each edge has a value

# Trie

aka. prefix tree / digital tree

- Used for storing strings/characters
- Check if a string is in the set of strings
