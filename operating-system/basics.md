# Operating System (OS)

- An **Operating System (OS)** is essential system software that manages computer hardware and provides services to computer programs and users.

- It acts as an intermediary between hardware and software, facilitating hardware resource management and software execution.

- Key OS functions include:

  - **Hardware Management:** Manages CPU, memory, storage, and peripheral devices.
  - **Process Management:** Schedules and controls program execution.
  - **File System Management:** Organizes and stores data on storage devices.
  - **User Interface:** Provides a means for users to interact with the computer.
  - **Security:** Implements user authentication and access control.
  - **Networking:** Supports network connectivity.
  - **Device Management:** Handles hardware device interaction.
  - **Error Handling:** Manages system errors and exceptions.

- The **kernel** is the core of the OS, responsible for low-level resource management and process control.

- The **shell** serves as the user interface, allowing users to interact with the OS through commands or graphical interfaces.

- Examples of OSs include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, each tailored for specific computing environments.

# Unix

- **Unix** is a family of influential, multiuser, and multitasking operating systems developed at AT&T's Bell Labs in the late 1960s.

- Key features:

  - Hierarchical file system.
  - Command-line interface.
  - Modularity and extensibility.

- Unix variants include Linux, macOS, BSD, AIX, Solaris, and HP-UX.

- Known for stability, security, and its impact on internet infrastructure and software development.

# POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)

- **POSIX** defines standards for maintaining compatibility across operating systems, making it easier to port programs between systems.

- For example, in Unix-like systems, it standardizes elements like stdin, stdout, and stderr, streamlining development.

- POSIX also provides standards for exit codes, filesystem operations, and command-line utilities, ensuring consistency across platforms.
